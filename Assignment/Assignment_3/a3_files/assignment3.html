                    This assignment will use concepts taught throughout the
                    course to extend the functionality of the provided tile
                    based game.
                    This assignment will ask you to extend the game with basic,
                    intermediate and advanced features.
                    For CSSE7030 students there will also be an open-ended
                    component.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The assignment will focus on the concept of Graphical User
                    Interfaces (GUIs). You will be requested to implement
                    extra functionality to the base game including extending the
                    GUI for a better game experience.

                <p>
                    Before begin work on the assignment you must download the
                    files provided from the course website or
                    blackboard. You only need to download one zip file called
                    <code>a3_files.zip</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once you extract the <code>a3_files.zip</code> zip you
                    should see a <code>a3.py</code> file, this
                    is the file where you will write your assignment. The other
                    files from the zip are support files
                    which you should not modified, their purpose is explained
                    below.

                <p><strong>*Note: </strong>Ideally, each game type would be in a
                    subdirectory called <code>game</code>, without the <code>game_</code>
                    prefix.
                    However, this would add complication for the student, so the
                    prefix was chosen instead for simplicity.</p>

                <h3>Event Listeners</h3><a name="sec_events"></a>
                <blockquote><strong>Note: </strong>In this section, the word
                    function is used to mean anything that is able to be called
                    like a function, such as a method, a lambda, etc.
                </blockquote>
                <p>

                    The *Game classes (<code>AbstractGame</code> and its
                    subclasses) and the <code>GridView</code>
                    class follow a pattern which allows you to attach a function
                    to be called when an event is triggered. This can be
                    referred to as binding to or listening for an event.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This pattern is called the Event Emitter pattern, and is an
                    implementation of the Observer pattern (the
                    Publisher/Subscriber pattern is similar).
                </p>
                <p>
                    While it is also quite a similar approach to how Tkinter
                    handles
                    commands for button presses, the Event Emitter pattern is
                    far more flexible in general.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The events that games and grid views emit
                    are useful in completing the assignment.
                    For task 1 you should consider listening for the select
                    event to appropriately update the score.
                    Postgraduate students are encouraged to consider emitting
                    their own events.

                <h2 class="header">Task 1 - Basic GUI</h2><a
                    name="sec_task1"></a>

                <p>
                    The purpose of this task is to create the basic graphical
                    user interface (GUI) for the Lolo game. You may choose any
                    one of the supplied games (Regular, Make 13, Lucky 7,
                    Unlimited).
                    There are several sub-tasks that need to be completed for
                    this task. You will be working towards
                    creating the user interface demonstrated below.
                </p>
                <div class="card">
                    <div class="card-image">

                        <img src="images/example_basic_gui.png"/>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card-content">
                        <span class="card-title">Basic GUI Example</span>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>Basic GUI</h3><a name="sec_app"></a>

                <p>
                    The very first part of this task is to implement a class for
                    the basic GUI. This class should be named
                    <code>LoloApp</code> and
                    should inherit from <code>BaseLoloApp</code>. The <code>BaseLoloApp</code>
                    class provides some support code to simplify the complex
                    process of animating.
                </p>
                <p>

                    As the basic GUI is improved in subsequent tasks, <strong>the
                    LoloApp class will need to be modified accordingly</strong>.
                </p>

                <h3>Status Bar</h3><a name="sec_score"></a>

                <p>
                    Define a class named <code>StatusBar</code>, which inherits
                    from <code>tk.Frame</code>.
                    This class must display three labels, with the following
                    text and alignment:
                </p>
                <ul class="browser-default">
                    <li><code>{game_mode_name} Game</code> <em>(Left)</em><br>
                        The name of whichever game mode the player is currently
                        playing.
                    </li>
                    <li><code>Score: {score}</code> <em>(Right)</em><br>
                        Must be updated whenever the player's score changes.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Note: </strong> For convenience, you should have
                    three methods, one for each of the relevant labels:
                    <code>set_game(game_mode)</code> &amp; <code>set_score(score)</code>.
                </p>

                <h3>Logo</h3><a name="sec_lolo_logo"></a>

                <p>
                    Define a class named <code>LoloLogo</code>, which inherits
                    from
                    <code>tk.Canvas</code>. This class must draw a simple logo,
                    similar to the one seen in examples, made out of canvas
                    shapes. It does not need to be resizable.
                </p>

                <p>You are encouraged to extend on the complexity of the design
                    but no extra marks will be awarded.
                </p>

                <h3>File Menu</h3><a name="sec_menu"></a>

                <p>
                    Implement a menu bar, with a <code>File</code> menu. The
                    File menu should have the following entries:
                </p>
                <ul class="browser-default">
                    <li><code>New Game</code>: Restarts the game.</li>
                    <li><code>Exit</code>: Exits the application.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Note:</strong> On Mac OS X, this should appear in the
                    global menu bar (top of the screen).</p>

                <h3>Lightning Button</h3><a name="sec_zap_btn"></a>

                <p>Implement a button, which when pressed, deletes a random tile
                    from the game grid.</p>

                <h3>Dialog</h3><a name="sec_dialog"></a>

                <p>
                    Implement an the following dialog boxes:
                </p>

                <ul class="browser-default">
                    <li>Invalid Activation: If the user attempts to activate a
                        tile that cannot be activated, show an error dialog with
                        an appropriate message.
                    </li>
                    <li>Game Over: The the game ends, show a dialog informing
                        the user of their score.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Keyboard Shortcuts</h3><a name="sec_keyboard"></a>

                <p>
                    Implement the following keyboard shortcuts:
                </p>

                <ul class="browser-default">
                    <li><code>ctrl + n</code>: Start new game.</li>
                    <li><code>ctrl + l</code>: Performs the lightning action.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Note:</strong> Ideally, <code>cmd</code>
                    would be used on Mac instead of <code>ctrl</code>.
                    It is permitted to also
                    bind to <code>cmd</code> on Mac, however <code>ctrl</code>
                    must also be implemented.</p>

                <h2 class="header">Task 2 - Intermediate Features</h2><a
                    name="sec_task2"></a>

                <p>The purpose of this task is to extend the functionality of
                    the basic GUI by adding a loading screen & high score
                    window.</p>

                <p>Instead of the basic GUI, the loading screen should be
                    displayed upon launching the game.</p>

                <div class="card">
                    <div class="card-image">

                        <img src="images/example_loading.png"/>

                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>Auto-Playing Game</h3><a name="sec_autoplaying_game"></a>

                <p>Implement a class, <code>AutoPlayingGame</code>, which
                    inherits from <code>BaseLoloApp</code>. This class must be
                    able
                    to display either a static or automatically played game.
                </p>
                <blockquote><strong>Hint: </strong> this can be achieved by
                    initially displaying a static representation of the game,
                    and implementing a method that begins the game playing.
                </blockquote>

                <p>The player
                    should not be able to interact with this class. For
                    automatically played games, a random valid tile should be
                    chosen each move, and the game should restart after the game
                    ends.</p>

                <h3>Loading Screen</h3><a name="sec_loading_screen"></a>

                <p>The loading screen must be the first thing the player sees
                    when they start the game. It must contain all of the
                    components from the example above. You may lay them out
                    however
                    you wish, provided it is reasonable.</p>

                <p>Required components:</p>
                <ul class="browser-default">
                    <li><strong>Logo:</strong> should be reused from task 1 (see

                <h3>High Score Window</h3><a name="sec_high_score_window"></a>

                <p>The high score window should be displayed in a separate
                    window to the main application. It can be accessed
                    through the button on the loading screen, or through the
                    file menu (a new entry must be added).</p>

                <p>The high score window contain all of the
                    components from the example above, laid out as shown.</p>

                <p>Required components:</p>
                <ul class="browser-default">
                    <li><strong>Best Player:</strong> display their name, score,

                <h3>Multiple Game Modes</h3><a
                    name="sec_multiple_game_modes"></a>

                <p>On the loading screen, add a <code>Game Mode</code> button
                    underneath <code>New Game</code>. When pressed, this should
                    open a window that allows the user to choose the game mode.
                    If the user hasn't entered their name yet, they should be
                    prompted with a dialog box.
                </p>

                <p>The window must have a series of <code>Radiobuttons</code>,
                    one for each available game mode, with the current game mode
                    pre-selected. It must also contain a visual example and
                    the name of the currently selected game mode. This
                    must update whenever a <code>Radiobutton</code> is selected.
                    For the visual example, <code>AutoPlayingGame</code> can
                    be reused here.</p>

                <p>Modify <code>New Game</code> so that it
                    starts a game of the currently selected mode.</p>

                <p>Initially, your application must include all of the provided
                    game types (Regular, Make 13, Lucky 7). Any additional
                    game types added must also be included (see <a
                            href="#sec_objective_game_modes">Objective Game
                        Modes</a>, <a href="#sec_postgrad">Open-Ended</a>).</p>

                <h3>Objective Game Mode</h3><a
                    name="sec_objective_game_modes"></a>

                An objective game mode is an extension of the regular game mode,
                in which the player has a number of tiles as objectives. The
                player's goal is to join tiles to eliminate each objective tile.
                For each objective tile, the player must form a tile with the
                same type and with at least the value of the objective. Once
                this happens, the objective tile is eliminated, and tile that
                was joined should be removed from the game grid.

                <p>The player may eliminate objective tiles in any order. The
                    game is won only if they eliminate all objectives before the
                    move limit is reached.</p>

                <p>Objective game modes should be able to be loaded from a
                    <code>JSON</code>
                    file in the following format:</p>

                <pre>
{
    "mode": "objective",
    "min_group": 3, // the minimum number of tiles to form a group
    "types": 4, // the number of tile types
    "size": [6, 6], // the number of [rows, columns]
    "starting_grid": ..., // optionally defines the starting grid
    "objectives": [...], // a representation of the objective tiles
    "limit": 90, // the number of moves the user can make
}
                </pre>

                <p>The game grid should be randomly generated unless the <code>starting_grid</code>
                    key is present. For <code>starting_grid</code> & <code>objectives</code>,
                    it may be useful to use a similar representation as <code>HighScoreManager</code>
                    does (see <code>high score.json</code>).</p>
